DotEmacs
========

This repository contains my personal Emacs configuration and installed packages. It is originally meant for personal uses and helps me keep my Emacs files when moving onto another machine. I've kept this repository public for other Emacs lovers.

Have fun tinkering : j

Notes
=====

**Recent changes to the way I initialize the different packages, some bug appeared in my Emacs setup.
They are marked with a *TOFIX* comment.**

This has been tested with railwaycat's [Emacs Mac port for Homebrew](https://github.com/railwaycat/homebrew-emacsmacport) and should work with any build.
