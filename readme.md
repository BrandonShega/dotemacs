DotEmacs
========


This repository contains my personal Emacs configuration (and installed packages). It was originally meant for
personal uses and to help me keep my Emacs files when moving onto another machine. I've kept this repository
public for other Emacs lovers.

Have fun tinkering : j


Notes
=====


This has been tested with [railwaycat's Mac port][railwaycat-emacs] and should work with any build.

Flycheck
--------


I use [`flycheck`][flycheck] as linter framework to display syntax warnings and errors whithin each buffer. See
below for the linters I personally use:

```bash
# Python
pip install flake8

# SCSS
gem install scss_lint scss_lint_reporter_checkstyle
```
