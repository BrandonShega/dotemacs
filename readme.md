DotEmacs
========


This repository contains my personal Emacs configuration (and installed
packages). It was originally meant for personal uses and to help me keep my
Emacs files when moving onto another machine. I've kept this repository public
for other Emacs lovers.

Have fun tinkering : j


Notes

This has been tested with railwaycat's [Emacs Mac port for Homebrew][railwaycat-emacs]

Flycheck
--------


I use [flycheck][flycheck] as linter framework to display syntax warnings and
errors whithin each buffer. See below for the linters I personally use:

```bash
# Python
pip install flake8

# SCSS
gem install scss_lint scss_lint_reporter_checkstyle
```
