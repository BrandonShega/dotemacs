# DotEmacs

This repository contains my personal Emacs configuration. It was originally meant for personal uses
and to help me keep track of my Emacs files accross several machines. I've kept this repository
public for other Emacs lovers.

Have fun tinkering : j

# Screenshots

My Emacs configuration is a living mixture of files that are modified on a daily basis. As such,
the following screenshots might not reflect `:master`.

# Installation

## Emacs

1. I use [Mitsuharu Yamamoto's Mac port][github-emacs]. The configuration files *should*
   work with any build nonetheless. In any case, install Emacs 24 or above.
1. Clone `dotemacs/` into `~/.emacs.d/`.
1. Edit `~/.emacs.d/lisp/init-constants.el` to suit your needs.

## Flycheck

I use [`flycheck`][flycheck] as linter framework to display syntax warnings and errors whithin each
buffer. See below for the linters I personally use:

```bash
# Python
pip install flake8

# SCSS
gem install scss_lint scss_lint_reporter_checkstyle
```

You can configure the way linters check buffers with their own configuration files. You may refer
to their very documentation.

- `flake8`: `~/.flake8rc`
- `scss-lint`: `~/.scss-lint.yml`
