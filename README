DotEmacs
========


This repository contains my personal Emacs configuration (and installed packages). It was originally meant for personal uses and to help me keep my Emacs files when moving onto another machine. I've kept this repository public for other Emacs lovers.

Have fun tinkering : j


Notes
=====


This has been tested with [Yamamoto Mitsuharu's Mac port][yamamoto-emacs] and should work with any build.

Installation
============


Emacs
-----


1. I use [Yamamoto Mitsuharu's Mac port][yamamoto-emacs-releases]. The configuration files should work with any build nonetheless. In any case, install Emacs 24 or above.

1. Clone `dotemacs/` into `~/.emacs.d/`.

1. Edit `~/.emacs.d/lisp/init-constants.el` to suit your needs.

Flycheck
--------


I use [`flycheck`][flycheck] as linter framework to display syntax warnings and errors whithin each buffer. See below for the linters I personally use:

```bash
# Python
pip install flake8

# SCSS
gem install scss_lint scss_lint_reporter_checkstyle
```

You can configure the way linters check buffers with their own configuration files. You may refer to their documentation.

- `flake8`: `~/.flake8rc`
- `scss-lint`: `~/.scss-lint.yml`
